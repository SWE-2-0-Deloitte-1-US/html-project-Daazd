            <h2>Professional Career and Development</h2>
            <p>My career started in 2010 when I first got a job in retail. I started out in a grocery store called Smith's. At this job I learned alot and it set the tone of how I wanted to conduct myself professionally, as well as in my personal life. I was a bagger so I did the menial task cleaning, bagging, and grabbing carts in the Las Vegas summers. Through perseverance I was able to move my way up to an overnight stocker. This job was one of my favorites. It taught me alot about personal accountability and working with a team to accomplish a singular goal. I was able to move up to Grocery Manager that is where my love of data analytics came from. Smith's rolled out a new inventory and analysis system which I was selected to teach/mentor to other managers. Through this I learned how to be a leader which propelled me in my career. Shortly after this I left Las Vegas and came to Arizona where, for the most part, I managed inventory systems and helped companies efficiently manage their inventory control measures. After working in warehouses I went back to retail grocery at Safeway. Here I was able to accumulate all my knowledge and put it into practice. I was shortly promoted to Grocery Manager and took an idea to my boss on how to manage inventory control better using analytics and trending models. This system improved their overall efficiency and brought a greater profit margin to the company as a whole, while this was great for them it was even better for me due to the fact I got to train everyone on the system. This solidified my want and need to get into tech. I have had a love for computers and computer systems but this really put it in my head that i was capable of achieving a career in tech. Now I have an excellent opportunity to grow my knowledge as well as grow as a professional. Through my technical knowledge and aptitude I will achieve my goal.</p>
            <h2>Personal Life and Development</h2>
             <p>I was born in Panama City, Florida and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. My father was in the military so we moved around alot. We finally ended up staying in Las Vegas for most of my childhood. Throughout my life I have wanted to know how things worked down to the very core. My father and grandfather instilled a love of history from a very young age so generally that was all I read, I like to focus on Ancient Civilizations and early cultural development. Through this I developed a great skill, research, which has helped me numerous times to build my problem solving skills. I love to play soccer that was my passion growing up and it instilled me a sense of purpose and cultivated my team work skills. I have always been a lover of video games and anything technical, I built my first computer at ten using windows 95. Through this I discovered my love for working with my hands and solving technical problems. This love has propelled me into the position I currently have. I was also an avid martial artist for many years and I still train to this day. My discipline was Shaolin Kung Fu. This training helped me immensely by fortifying my mind as well as my body, I would not be the person I am without my teachers who gave me rigorous instruction and guidance. Through this training I was able to travel to China at multiple points and train younger generations. This taught me even more how to be a leader and lead with compassionate discipline. This also gave me another view of the world as the kids I trained came from impoverished settings and truly showed me how privileged I am living in this country. Through all these experiences a culmination of events brought me to this point with this mindset and view. Without these life experiences I surely wouldnt be the person I am today.</p>

            The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. A process that cannot be understood by stopping it. We must move with the flow of the process. We must join it.
